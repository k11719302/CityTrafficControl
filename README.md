## Coding conventions

### Unit Tests
- The namespace-structure must match with the general project structure
- Every unit test file must only contain one testclass and match the name
- The name of every unit test class must end with "Tests" (eg. DataLinkerTests)
- The name of every unit test method must start with "Test_" (eg. Test_SendInvalidData)
- Every unit test method must be structured into the required sections (see UnitTestTemplate-file)
